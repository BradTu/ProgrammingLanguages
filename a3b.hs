  {-
  WildcardPat matches everything and produces the empty list of bindings
  VariablePat s matches any value v and produces the one-element list holding (s, v).
  UnitPat matches only Unit and produces the empty list of bindings
  ConstantPat 17 matches only against Constant 17 and produces the empty list of bindings (and similarly for other integers)
  ConstructorPat (s1, p) matches Constructor(s2, v) if s1 and s2 are the same string (you can compare them with ==) and p
      matches v. The list of bindings produced in the list from the nested pattern match. We call the strings s1 and s2 the constructor names.
  TuplePat ps matches a value of the form Tuple vs if ps and vs have the same length and for all i, the ith element of ps matches the ith
      element of vs. The list of bindings produced is all the lists from the nested pattern matches appended together.
  Nothing else mattersâ„¢. In case that's not clear, in all other cases you return Nothing.

  g takes two functions as arguments (f1 and f2) and a Pattern data type.

  For Variable pat it takes f2 and returns the a number based off of the corresponding number x with it
