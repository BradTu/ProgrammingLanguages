Haskell, Racket and Prolog programs from my Programming Languages class

All of the functions have descriptions of what they do and inputs that the require.

To run the Haskell programs you will need to go to https://www.haskell.org/downloads and download the appropriate software.

To run the Racket program you will need to go to https://download.racket-lang.org/ and download the appropriate software.

To run the Prolog program you will need to go to http://www.gprolog.org/ and download the appropriate software.
